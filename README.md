Its a me, a random guy! I am currently learning to make Minecraft Mods! I like to code and I like the science and math fields as well. 

Hey look! A bunch of numbers! (go check out Hackclub) (also only half of my coding is listed on this list, i'm not allowed to track coding for school projects as stated by certain Hackclub events)
